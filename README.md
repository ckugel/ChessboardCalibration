# About
### This repo is for a PLTW Engineeering Development and Design course
This project will handle the creation of the disparity map for the stereo cameras.
This project is made in C++ using OpenCV. The development platform itself is in Docker to avoid the need of installing the necessary libraries on every system that we use.

### Project
Our project is making a digital twin of a conflict zone in order to provide logistical and strategical information for victims in need of humanitarian aid and safe escape routes. The project will use a multitude of sensors such as drones, fixed cameras, and cameras on viechles in order to make the point cloud that the digital twin relies on for relating colected information to the real world.

This project heavilyy uses code from opencv's examples on their repositories.
you do need opencv c++ installed on your computer to run this
